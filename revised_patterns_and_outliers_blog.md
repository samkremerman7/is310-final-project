## Revised Patterns and Outliers

My main interests in these readings stem from Pudding article's by Erin Davis titled â€œWhat physical traits are most tied to gender in literature?" by Erin Davis and "The Courage (and Disappointment) of Pitching a Visual Essay". I found the first of which to be intersting as I haven't really seen many instances of mining through literature. However, as a result of Davis's efforts, her reader's can now acknowledge, have discourse about, and change the gendered steroetypes in text that is in our literature. It is very cool to see code being used to produce social good. Additionally, the illustrations by Liana Sposto were very pleasing.

I felt that the article "The Courage (and Disappointment) of Pitching a Visual Essay" was very relatable. I too commonly doubt by academic and professional skills so it was refreshing to here someone else talk about their process working through the anxiety of working through this. It was also refreshing to see that Davis got rejected once before she got her work published. Additionally, her advice to work on something compelling that you geniunely was more meaningful as she is became successful doing exactly that.
