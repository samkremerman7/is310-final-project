# State Environmental Legislation and Carbon Footprint Per Capita

My final project’s topic will be tracking new instances of environmental legislation in a state, as well as the carbon footprint per capita in that state in the last decade. I selected this topic because environmental legislation is a big area of controversy within American politics today. On the right side of the political spectrum, environmental deregulation is at the front of its policy as seen by the fact that previous president, Donald Trump, and his administration pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement and rolled back efficiency standards through the Department of Energy. Meanwhile, on the left side of the political spectrum, the Joe Biden administration supports some level of environmental regulation, but has had pressure from his further left-leaning constitutions who want something closer to the amount of regulation in the previously proposed “Green New Deal”.

I am personally interested in this topic because environmental legislation is one of my top issues when it comes to politics. I do not have an abundance of knowledge when it comes to environmental sciences. However, I do have some knowledge from Advanced Placement Environmental Science in high school and Environmental Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. My knowledge as far as legislation goes comes from my involvement in “Act Green”, which is a student-run organization that focuses on making future business leaders more environmentally conscious, as well as my time as Environmental chair at the Evans Scholarship house, and my own political research.

Some relevant outside sources that I will be using to get my data include the U.S. Energy Information Administration and each state’s environmental protection agencies. My end goal for my map would be something similar to the map in Bill Rankins and Matt Daniel’s “The Shape ofSlavery”. I want to base my work on this reading in particular because I believe that it did one of the best jobs of incorporating computing into reading in order to be more informative. The map immediately immerses the reader into the topic and provides the reader with critical information from the article.

In terms of my proposed methodology, I intend to take a more data-driven approach. I intend to narrow my topic down to the question “Does statewide environmental legislation decrease carbon footprint?” I believe the data I need to answer this question already exists and is publicly accessible. I intend to use a python sorting algorithm in order to organize the data that I will draw from the excel files provided on websites or excel files that I will manually create. Then, I intend to use Javascript, an easier coding language for mapping and one that I have experience in, to code this data onto a map. Finally, I will write a professional analysis attempting to add to the discourse of my research question based on what I have learned.

I intend on breaking up my project into four large sections. I intend to get all my data collection, cleaning, and sorting done by our April 7th project update presentation deadline. I then plan on learning the Javascript necessary to do the mapping I need by April 21st. By the May 3rd Final Presentation deadline I want to have my map fully completed and functional. Finally, I will spend the remaining ten days writing my analysis article for the May 13th final deadline.
